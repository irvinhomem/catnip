catnip is a remote mirroring suite that can apply an optional BPF codechain (for example with a pcap-filter, such as `host 8.8.8.8 and port 53`) generated by the connecting client and the server then streams captured packets over a UDP data channel back.  The client decodes the payload and squirts it into a tuntap interface that you can then use tcpdump on.

This makes the server a very small stub, suitable to be installed on an embedded environment; as it does not need libpcap (the client does need libpcap though).

# Running the Server
To run the server type as root:

    tcpsvd -vv 0 34343 ./catnipd

# Running the Client
Client commands (`catnip -h` provides usage help):

## list the interfaces at the remote end

    ./catnip -H server -D

## plain packet mirroring

    sudo ./catnip -H server -i eth0

You will now find a local `tun0` interface for you to capture on with:

    sudo tcpdump -i tap0 -n

## packet mirroring with a filter

    sudo ./catnip -H server -i ppp0 'host www.sixxs.net'

You will now find a local `tun0` interface for you to capture on with:

    sudo tcpdump -i tun0 -n

This one will only mirror packets that match the filter `host www.sixxs.net` (which has IPv4 and IPv6 addresses).
