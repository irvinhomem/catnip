catnip is a remote mirroring suite that can apply an optional BPF codechain (for example with a pcap-filter, such as '`host 8.8.8.8 and port 53`') generated by the connecting client and the server then streams captured packets over a UDP data channel back.  The client decodes the payload and squirts it into a tuntap interface that you can then use tcpdump on.

This makes the server a very small stub, suitable to be installed on an embedded environment; as it does not need libpcap (the client does need libpcap though).

To run the server type as root:

    tcpsvd -vv 0 34343 ./catnipd

Client commands ('`catnip -h`' provides usage help):

 * list the interfaces at the remote end

    ./catnip -H server -D

 * plain packet mirroring (creates a tap0 interface)

    sudo ./catnip -H server -i eth0
    sudo tcpdump -i tap0 -n

 * packet mirroring with a filter (creates a tun0 interface)

    sudo ./catnip -H server -i ppp0 'host www.sixxs.net'
    sudo tcpdump -i tun0 -n

The last one will only mirror packets that match the filter '`host www.sixxs.net`' (which has IPv4 and IPv6 addresses).
