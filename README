catnip is a remote mirroring suite that can apply an optional BPF codechain
generated by the connecting client and the server then streams captured
packets over a UDP data channel back.  The client decodes the payload and
squirts it into a tuntap interface that you can then use tcpdump on.

This makes the server a very small stub, suitable to be installed on an
embedded environment; as it does not need libpcap.

To run the server:
  tcpsvd -vv 0 34343 ./catnipd

The client is run as:
  ./catnip -H server -D
